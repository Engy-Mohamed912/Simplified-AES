# Simplified AES Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a simplified implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption and decryption. AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm for securing sensitive data.

## Overview

The code provided here demonstrates a simplified version of the AES algorithm using C. It includes functions for both encryption and decryption, allowing users to secure their data using this algorithm.

## Features

- **Encryption:** The `encrypt` function takes plaintext and a key as input and generates the corresponding ciphertext.
- **Decryption:** The `decrypt` function takes the ciphertext and the same key used for encryption to recover the original plaintext.
